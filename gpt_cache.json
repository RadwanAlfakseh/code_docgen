It does this by first checking a cache (`_cache_tz_name`) to see if it has already been initialized. If not, it initializes the cache with the result of calling the `_get_localzone_name` function.\n\nOnce the cache is initialized or the function returns the cached value.",

The function uses a cache `_cache_tz` to store the result of the previous call to `_get_localzone`, in order to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary calls to this function. If `_cache_tz` is `None`, it means that there is no cached value available, so the function calls `_get_localzone` to retrieve the local timezone and caches the result for future use. The return type of the function is `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo`, which represents a time zone in Python.",

It takes no arguments and returns a `ZoneInfo` object representing the current local timezone. The function first retrieves the name of the local timezone using the `_get_localzone_name()` function, then uses that name to retrieve the corresponding `ZoneInfo` object using the `_get_localzone()` function. Finally, it stores the retrieved `ZoneInfo` object in a global cache variable called `_cache_tz`.\n\nThe purpose of this function is to allow for updating the local timezone without having to restart the program. By calling this function when the user's system time zone changes, the program can automatically update its internal representation of the local timezone and continue running with the new settings."
